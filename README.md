# Druid Starter Kit

The most comprehensive and battle-tested Laravel + Vue starter kit available. Built with modern best practices, complete testing coverage, and production-ready tooling to accelerate your development from day one. Features cutting-edge technologies like Laravel 13, Inertia 3, Vue 3 with TypeScript, Tailwind 4, and a complete CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment.

Unlike other starter kits that give you a basic setup and leave you to figure out the rest, Druid provides a complete development ecosystem. Every component is tested, every workflow is automated, and every decision has been made with scalability and maintainability in mind. From comprehensive testing with Pest and Vitest to automated semantic releases, this isn't just a starter kit, it's a complete foundation for building production applications that can grow with your business.

> **Druid includes all Laravel Jetstream and Fortify features** - Teams, API tokens, profile management, two-factor authentication, browser sessions, password reset, email verification, and more - rebuilt from the ground up with Vue 3, TypeScript, and 100% test coverage.
